# cbcopy

cbcopy is designed to migrate Greenplum Database clusters, including both metadata and data, to Cloudberry Database clusters. It is also used for data migration between different Cloudberry Database clusters for disaster recovery and specific version upgrades.

## How does cbcopy work?

### Metadata migration
The metadata migration feature of cbcopy is based on gpbackup and gprestore. Its primary advantage over the built-in pg_dump of GPDB lies in its use of batch retrieval for metadata. Unlike pg_dump, which fetches metadata one row at a time, cbcopy retrieves it in batches. This approach significantly enhances performance, particularly when migrating large volumes of metadata from the source database compared to pg_dump.
### Data migration

Both GPDB and CBDB support starting programs via SQL commands, and cbcopy utilizes this feature. During data migration, it uses SQL commands to start a program on the target database to receive and load data, while simultaneously using SQL commands to start a program on the source database to unload data and send it to the program on the target database.

## Pre-Requisites

The project requires the Go Programming language version 1.19 or higher. Follow the directions [here](https://golang.org/doc/) for installation, usage and configuration instructions.

## Downloading

```bash
go get TBD
```

## Building and installing binaries
Switch your current working directory to the above `cbcopy` source directory

**Build**

```bash
make
```
This will build the cbcopy and cbcopy_helper binaries in the source directory.

**Install**

```bash
make install
```
This will install the cbcopy and cbcopy_helper programs binaries the $GPHOME/bin directory. Note that GPDB must be sourced for this to work.

## Test
```bash
make test
```
Runs the unit tests


## Migrating Data with cbcopy

Before migrating data, you need to copy cbcopy_helper to the $GPHOME/bin directory on all nodes of both the source and target databases. Then you need to find a host that can connect to both the source database and the target database, and use the cbcopy command on that host to initiate the migration.By default, both metadata and data are migrated.

### Database version requirements
cbcopy relies on the "COPY ON SEGMENT" command of the database, so it has specific version requirements for the database.

- `GPDB 4.x` - A minimum of GPDB version 4.3.17 or higher is required. If your version does not meet this requirement, you can upgrade to GPDB 4.3.17.
- `GPDB 5.x` - cbcopy is compatible with all versions of GPDB 5.x.
- `GPDB 6.x` - cbcopy is compatible with all versions of GPDB 6.x.
- `CBDB 1.x` - cbcopy is compatible with all versions of CBDB 1.x.

### Migration Modes

cbcopy supports seven migration modes.

- `--full` - Migrate all metadata and data from the source database to the target database.
- `--dbname` - Migrate a specific database or multiple databases from the source to the target database.
- `--schema` - Migrate a specific schema or multiple schemas from the source database to the target database.
-  `--schema-mapping-file` - Migrate specific schemas specified in a file from the source database to the target database.
- `--include-table` - Migrate specific tables or multiple tables from the source database to the target database.
- `--include-table-file` - Migrate specific tables specified in a file from the source database to the target database.
- `--global-metadata-only` - Migrate global objects from the source database to the target database.

### Data Loading Modes
cbcopy supports two data loading modes.

- `--append` - Insert the migrated records into the table directly, regardless of the existing records.
- `--truncate` - First, clear the existing records in the table, and then insert the migrated records into the table.


### Object dependencies

If the tables you are migrating depend on certain global objects, you need to include the --with-globalmeta option (default: false) during the migration; otherwise, the creation of these tables in the target database will fail.

### Role
If you want to change the table owner information during migration, which means you do not want to create the same role in the target database (disable the --with-globalmeta option), you need to first create the corresponding role in the target database. Then, use the --owner-mapping-file to specify the mapping between the source role and the target role; otherwise, the creation of tables in the target database will fail.

### Tablespace
- `--tablespace` - We support migrating all source database objects into a single tablespace on the target database(Other modes besides the --full mode).if you need to migrate database objects from different schemas into different tablespaces, the best practice might be to migrate one schema at a time from the source database


### Parallel Jobs

- `--copy-jobs` - The maximum number of tables that concurrently copies.


### Validate Migration
During migration, we will compare the number of rows returned by COPY TO from the source database (i.e., the number of records coming out of the source database) with the number of rows returned by COPY FROM in the target database (i.e., the number of records loaded in the target database). If the two counts do not match, the migration of that table will fail.

### Copy Strategies

cbcopy internally supports three copy strategies for tables.

- `Copy On Master` - If the table's statistics pg_class->reltuples is less than --on-segment-threshold, cbcopy will enable the Copy On Master strategy for this table, meaning that data migration between the source and target databases can only occur through the master node.

- `Copy On Segment` - If the table's statistics pg_class->reltuples is greater than --on-segment-threshold, and both the source and target databases have the same version and the same number of nodes, cbcopy will enable the Copy On Segment strategy for this table. This means that data migration between the source and target databases will occur in parallel across all segment nodes without data redistribution.
- `Copy on External Table` - For tables that do not meet the conditions for the above two strategies, cbcopy will enable the Copy On External Table strategy. This means that data migration between the source and target databases will occur in parallel across all segment nodes with data redistribution.

### Result files
After the cbcopy finishes running, it generates some files in the $USER/gpAdminLogs directory. The cbcopy_$timestamp.log file contains all the logs, including debugging and error messages. Additionally, there will be cbcopy_succeed_$timestamp and cbcopy_failed_$timestamp files, which contain the tables that were processed successfully and those that failed.

### Multiple migrations
If, after migration, some tables migrate successfully while others fail, we can pass the cbcopy_succeed_$timestamp file to the --exclude-table-file option. This way, we can avoid re-migrating the tables that have already been successfully migrated.

### Statistics Used by the cbcopy
When migrating in a production environment, a good strategy is to perform an analyze command on tables with a large amount of data in advance. cbcopy will use statistics of the table to decide whether to migrate only through the master or through all the segment nodes

## Examples
```
cbcopy --with-globalmeta --source-host=127.0.0.1 --source-port=45432 --source-user=gpadmin --dest-host=127.0.0.1 --dest-port=55432 --dest-user=cbdb --dbname=testdb --truncate
```
